TOOLS USED
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn


Objectives
Load and preprocess the dataset
Normalize features using `StandardScaler`
Train KNN classifier with different values of K
Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Visualize decision boundaries using two features


OUTPUT
